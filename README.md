# odin-admin-dashboard

Assignment from The Odin Project:
"Now that youâ€™ve had plenty of practice using Grid, we are going to build a full dashboard design. For this project, use whatever tools you need to get it done, but try to lean on Grid for the majority of the layout work. Go back through the lessons or practice assignments if you need a refresher."
